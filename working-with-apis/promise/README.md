# Promises

## promise terminology

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchrounous operation, and its resulting value.

A promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

A promise must return one of the following

- fulfilled - The action relating to the promise succeeded
- rejected - The action relating to the promise failed
- pending - Hasn't fulfilled or rejected yet
- settled - Has fulfilled or rejected
